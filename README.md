# Hackerrank_Java_Section

Hey thereðŸ˜ƒ
If you are an absolute beginner in Java, I got your covered. Because I recently switched from Python to Java. So I'm as thin as you are at this. 

The plan is simple. I'm learning and practicing on Hackerrank and soon on leetcode. So instead of making notes, I've created this repo where I'll put all the solutions, share some resources and hopefully explain the code I write.

But here's the catch. If you really want to learn and absorb the concepts, you are supposed to try it out yourself first. Spend some time googling and if you still can't figure out then come here and look at the solution. This is one way to retain what you learn. 

And feel free to suggest any good solutions and create PRs if you like. I would be happy to merge 'em. 

Happy Coding!âœ¨
